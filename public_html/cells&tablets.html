                 <p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab is a line of upper mid-range Android-based tablet computers produced by Samsung. 
                 It is similar to the Samsung Galaxy Note series except without the Samsung S-Pen.
                 The first model in the series, the 7-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab, was first introduced on 2 September 2010 at the IFA in Berlin.
                 Since then there have been several models released, including models with 7.7, 8.9 and 10.1-inch displays. 
                 The Wi-Fi versions of the tablet all include a GPS system whilst the 3G/4G tablets include cellular capability as well.
